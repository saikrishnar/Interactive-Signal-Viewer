      <p>The finger snaps have to be discriminated from other transients. In this algorithm a simplistic classification method was chosen,
relying on band-energy ratios, which are commonly used features in general audio recognition . Band-energy ratio (BER) is calculated as the ratio of the energy on a certain band compared to the total energy.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p> Practically the squared magnitudes of DFT bins belonging to a certain band are summed and divided by the sum of all squared bin magnitudes. The frequency bands in this application were chosen to be combined Bark bands so that three adjacent bands are merged, resulting in a total of eight bands (there are a total of 24 Bark bands).</p>

      <p>Each participant will have to record their snap pattern on three consecutive days. The sampling rate is 44.1 KHz</p>

  <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
  <p>The calculated BER vector is compared to an average vector by the Euclidean distance metric. The average vector is calculated beforehand from several finger snaps. If the Euclidean distance L 2 is below a certain threshold L 2,thr (e.g. 0.5), the frame is accepted </p>
